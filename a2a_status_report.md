# A2A System Status Report
*Generated: 2025-07-10 20:40 UTC*

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ What's Working:
- **Jules Server**: Running on port 5003 (healthy)
- **Task Queue**: 91 tasks total, including our 3 new dashboard tasks
- **Dashboard Server**: Running on port 8001
- **Tasks Submitted**: Successfully added camera feature tasks for CODEX and Jules

### ❌ Issues Found:
1. **Port Mismatch**: CODEX agent expects port 5000, but Jules is on port 5003
2. **Agents Not Processing**: CODEX and Jules agents aren't actively polling/processing tasks
3. **No Responses Yet**: Our dashboard enhancement tasks haven't been processed

### 🎯 Our Dashboard Tasks (Submitted ~20 minutes ago):
1. **CODEX Task**: Frontend camera widget, OCR integration, smart folders
2. **Jules Task**: Backend APIs for upload, OCR extraction, folder suggestions
3. **Coordination Task**: Overall project tracking

## 🔧 Next Steps to Fix:

1. **Option A**: Start agents with correct port configuration
2. **Option B**: Restart Jules server on expected port 5000
3. **Option C**: Update agent configurations to use port 5003

## 📈 Progress Summary:
- Tasks successfully submitted to A2A system ✅
- Agents need to be started/configured to process them ⏳
- Dashboard monitoring is available at http://localhost:8001/interactive_dashboard.html

The A2A system is set up correctly, but the agents need to be activated to start processing our camera feature tasks!
