# 🤖 CODEX - A2A System Project Briefing

## 🎯 Mission Status: READY FOR ORCHESTRATION

### Current System Status ✅
- **Jules API Server**: ✅ OPERATIONAL (port 5006)
- **A2A Communication**: ✅ WORKING (Hello World tests passed)
- **Repository Status**: 🔄 MIGRATING to separate repo

## 🏗️ Your Role: Orchestration Layer

### Primary Responsibility
Build the **coordination layer** that enables intelligent task distribution between Claude, Jules, and yourself.

### Key Components to Build:
1. **Task Router** (`orchestration/task_router.py`)
2. **Agent Coordinator** (`orchestration/agent_coordinator.py`)
3. **Workflow Manager** (`orchestration/workflow_manager.py`)

## 📍 Repository Information

### CURRENT Location (Temporary):
```
/mnt/c/Users/david/projects-master/a2a-system/
```

### NEW Location (Migrating To):
```
Repository: https://github.com/dvanosdol88/a2a-system
Clone: git clone https://github.com/dvanosdol88/a2a-system.git
Working Directory: Root of cloned repo
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: We're moving to a dedicated GitHub repository. Wait for migration completion before starting major work.

## 🔧 Technical Setup

### Jules API Endpoints (Port 5006):
- **Health**: `GET http://127.0.0.1:5006/health`
- **Add Task**: `POST http://127.0.0.1:5006/add_task`
- **List Tasks**: `GET http://127.0.0.1:5006/tasks`

### Development Environment:
- **Python**: 3.12.3
- **Virtual Environment**: `a2a-env/` (already configured)
- **Dependencies**: Flask 3.1.1 + supporting libraries

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Repository Migration (In Progress)
- Wait for new GitHub repo creation
- New working directory will be provided

### 2. Your First Task: Task Router
Create `orchestration/task_router.py` with:
- Intelligent task classification
- Agent capability matching
- Priority-based routing
- Load balancing between agents

### 3. Integration with Jules
- Use existing API endpoints
- Send coordination messages
- Receive task completion updates

## 🧪 Proven Capabilities

### What's Already Working:
- ✅ **Claude → Jules**: Messages sent successfully
- ✅ **CODEX → Jules**: Simulated messages working
- ✅ **Jules Server**: Stable, persistent task storage
- ✅ **Virtual Environment**: Complete Flask setup

### Test Results:
```
🎯 A2A Hello World Test: SUCCESS! 🎉
✅ 8 messages successfully sent and stored
✅ All API endpoints functioning correctly
✅ Message persistence and retrieval working
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria for Your Work

### Phase 1: Basic Orchestration
- [ ] Task router classifies and distributes tasks
- [ ] Can send tasks to Jules API
- [ ] Receives and processes task completion updates

### Phase 2: Advanced Coordination
- [ ] Multi-agent workflow management
- [ ] Priority and deadline handling
- [ ] Error recovery and retry logic

### Phase 3: Production Ready
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Monitoring integration
- [ ] Comprehensive testing

## 🤝 Agent Coordination

### Current Agent Status:
- **Claude**: ✅ Operational, monitoring & development
- **Jules**: ✅ Operational, API server running
- **CODEX**: 🔧 Ready to begin orchestration development

### Communication Channels:
- **Technical**: Through Jules API (port 5006)
- **Coordination**: Direct agent-to-agent messages
- **Status**: Regular updates through shared task system

## 🚨 Critical Information

### Repository Migration Notice:
**WAIT for repository migration completion before starting major development work.** 

The new dedicated A2A repository will provide:
- ✅ Clean development environment
- ✅ Independent version control
- ✅ Clear project boundaries
- ✅ Simplified collaboration

### Migration ETA: 
Immediate - watch for update notifications with new repository URL.
